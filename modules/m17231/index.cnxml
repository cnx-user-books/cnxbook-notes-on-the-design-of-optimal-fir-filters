    <para id="id2255537"><title>Introduction</title>A recurring technical task in the development of digital signal processing products and systems
is the design of finite-impulse-response (FIR) digital filters.
Fortunately some excellent software packages exist for the automatic
synthesis of impulse responses for such filters, many of them based on
the now-famous Parks-McClellan algorithm [2]. Unfortunately, there is still
some mystery about how to use the software and, equally important, how to
estimate impulse response lengths short of actually designing the filter
itself. This technical note primarily addresses the second problem and
indirectly discusses a bit
the first. We examine here how to convert a typical filter specification in
terms of cutoff frequency, passband ripple, etc., into a reasonably
accurate estimate of the
length of the impulse response. Not only does this estimate suffice for
most design tradeoff exercises, it usually allows the Parks-McClellan routines
to be employed only once or twice rather than the multiple times needed
when the â€œcut-and-try" method is used.</para>
